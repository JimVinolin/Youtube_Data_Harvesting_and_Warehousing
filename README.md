# Youtube_Data_Harvesting_and_Warehousing
The YouTube Data Harvesting and Warehousing project is a Python-based Streamlit app that allows users to access and analyze data from various YouTube channels. The app has features such as inputting a YouTube channel ID and retrieving all relevant data (channel name, subscribers, total video count, playlist ID, video ID, likes, dislikes, comments of each video) using Google API. The data can be stored in a MongoDB database as a data warehouse and queried with SQL 1.

The project is designed to demonstrate how to harvest and warehouse YouTube data using SQL, MongoDB, and Streamlit. The first step is to collect data from YouTube using the YouTube Data API. The API provides access to a wide range of data, including channel information, video statistics, and viewer engagement metrics. The collected data can be stored in a variety of ways. In this project, we will use MongoDB and SQL. MongoDB is a NoSQL database that is well-suited for storing large amounts of unstructured data. SQL is a relational database that is well-suited for querying and analyzing structured data. The data can be stored in a data warehouse, which is a centralized repository for data. Data warehouses are used to store large amounts of data from a variety of sources. They can be used to analyze data, identify trends, and make predictions. The data can be analyzed using a variety of tools. In this project, we will use Streamlit. Streamlit is a Python library that can be used to create interactive web applications. We will use Streamlit to create a dashboard that allows users to visualize and analyze the data 1.
